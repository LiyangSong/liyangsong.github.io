## About Me

Hi, my name is **Liyang Song**.

I am a deep learning researcher at the [Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University in
[Portland, Maine](https://www.visitportland.com/), working on computer vision and AI for healthcare.  

Recently, I led a project on video-based infant respiration estimation that resulted in a first-author paper at [WACV 2026](https://github.com/michaelwwan/air-400), and I now work on tools to analyze children’s pose and gaze in autism therapy sessions as part of the [DREAM project](https://github.com/LiyangSong/DREAM-ASD-Toolkit).

Before that, I completed my M.S. in Data Science at Northeastern University and worked as a data engineer and software developer in industry. I like
building systems that connect carefully-designed vision models with real-world clinical data.

Outside of work, I am an occasional INFJ, a long-time fan of strategy and RPG games, and an amateur photographer.

## Selected projects & publications

- **Overcoming Small Data Limitations in Video-Based Infant Respiration Estimation (WACV 2026)**  
We introduce the AIR-400 benchmark and pipeline for estimating infant respiration from heterogeneous clinical RGB/IR videos, including infant ROI detection, multiple optical-flow methods, spatiotemporal models, and PSD-based loss / post-processing.

- **DREAM-ASD Toolkit**  
Ongoing open-source toolkit for exploring skeleton, head pose, and gaze data from robot-enhanced autism therapy sessions. Provides preprocessing, visualization, and analysis utilities to support research on early ASD markers and engagement.

- **Systems & backend projects**  
I have also built PaxMesh, a transport-agnostic RPC framework with Paxos, CodeArena, a distributed online judge platform, a distributed key-value store, and several cloud-based ML pipelines using AWS, PostgreSQL, Docker, and message queues.

_More details and links are available on the [Projects](../../projects) page._

## Photography

I like shooting with my Fujifilm X-T30 II, mostly natural landscapes and everyday life.

So far I’ve taken it to highland snow mountains in northwestern China and to the coasts on both the East and West coasts of the United States. I also use it to record quieter moments with my family and our two cats.

I may start posting small photo selections on this site in the future.

&nbsp;

## Games

I mostly play strategy and simulation games, and story-driven RPGs.

On the strategy side, I enjoy games like *Oxygen Not Included*, *Civilization*, and *Stellaris*.  
What I like most is designing self-sustaining systems—watching a base or a city run almost automatically once all the pieces fit together.

On the RPG side, some of my favorites are *The Legend of Zelda* and *NieR:Automata*. I enjoy slow, immersive exploration: wandering through worlds that feel coherent and alive, and uncovering their stories at my own pace.

&nbsp;

## Movies

I love fantasy, adventure, sci-fi, epic, and road movies.

My all-time favorite is *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy.

&nbsp;

## Music

C-Pop, J-Pop, City Pop, OST, light music, and classical.

My playlists keep growing faster than I can organize them.

## About this site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework, styled with [Diary](https://github.com/amazingrise/hugo-theme-diary/) theme by [Rise](https://risehere.net/).

It serves as my personal homepage and a place to collect notes on research, systems, and things I enjoy.
